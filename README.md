The Haar Cascade algorithm is a machine learning-based approach for object detection. 
It uses a series of "Haar-like" features (simple rectangular features that capture the contrast between different regions in an image) to detect objects like faces and eyes.
The algorithm trains a classifier using positive (containing the object) and negative (without the object) image samples. It then applies this classifier to scan images in real-time, detecting faces or eyes by comparing the features with those learned during training. The system highlights detected regions with bounding boxes.
The system processes the image, identifies face and eye regions, and highlights them with bounding boxes, providing a visual output.
